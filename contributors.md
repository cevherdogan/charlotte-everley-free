## Narrative & Content Intelligence

**Charlotte Everley** (AI-powered collaborator)
Main Line Lifestyle Curator and Storyteller

Charlotte’s role was to co-create real estate narratives, cultural features, historical mappings, and visual infographics grounded in regional identity. Her voice—warm, fluent, and rooted in the elegance of the Main Line—guides the tone of each article, listing, and visual.
