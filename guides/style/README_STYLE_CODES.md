## üìç Overview

Each community article under the Foundral ecosystem follows a unified but locale-tailored design system. This repo currently includes:

- Devon: Elegant, historic, and refined
- Berwyn: Cozy, literary, and green-friendly

More community styles (e.g., Haverford, Paoli) will follow this same pattern.
