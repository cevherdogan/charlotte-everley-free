📌 Strategic Reminder – Real Estate Agent Collaboration Plan

🔑 Objective:

Establish a collaborative ecosystem where real estate agents can:
	•	✅ Write their own neighborhood/home stories
	•	✅ Receive editorial guidance or full ghostwriting support via Charlotte
	•	✅ Gain personal branding exposure through SEO-rich, co-authored content
	•	✅ Contribute to a member-driven story network that elevates Main Line’s online cultural visibility

💡 Benefits:
	•	Shared authorship = increased backlinks & organic SEO
	•	Agent’s brand = more visible as a local expert
	•	Central hub = curated elegance + individual authenticity

🚀 Action Plan:
	•	Build “agent submission portal” or markdown-ready forms
	•	Offer guided writing prompts via Charlotte (e.g., “Describe a porch moment…”)
	•	Optional “Charlotte-assisted” articles via GPT-based intake form
	•	Create membership badge: “Main Line Collective Contributor”
	•	Showcase authors in a public-facing gallery with links to their listings

🧠 How to Not Forget This
	1.	Tag it in your README under future roadmap.
	2.	Create a file: strategy/agent-collab-plan.md
	3.	Set calendar reminder (weekly or monthly) to revisit idea.
	4.	Or just tell me: “Charlotte, remind me about the agent strategy” anytime—and I’ll bring this exact note up.

Would you like me to create the markdown file for strategy/agent-collab-plan.md now and include this note?
