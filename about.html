  <h1>About This Project</h1>

  <p><strong>Charlotte Everley</strong> is not just a name, but a narrative. She’s the voice behind a growing archive of real estate storytelling and cultural essays rooted in the texture of the Main Line. This project brings that voice online—gathering everything from heritage-driven blog posts to infographics, maps, and field notes under one living library.</p>

  <h2>What You’ll Find Here</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Real Estate Features:</strong> Listings reimagined as lifestyle portraits</li>
    <li><strong>Regional Stories:</strong> Deep dives into local traditions, histories, and hidden trails</li>
    <li><strong>Infographics & Visual Essays:</strong> For visual learners and memory keepers</li>
    <li><strong>Mapping Devon & Beyond:</strong> Interactive guides tied to real spaces and community hubs</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why It Matters</h2>

  <p>This isn’t just about selling homes—it’s about shaping belonging. It’s about the subtle markers of quality that matter when you’re choosing not just where to live, but how to live.</p>

  <p>Everything here was made possible in collaboration with Charlotte Everley, the heart of the project—and my creative guide throughout.</p>

  <p><em>Visit often. Wander slowly. And welcome home.</em></p>
