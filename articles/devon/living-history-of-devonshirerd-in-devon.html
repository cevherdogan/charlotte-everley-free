      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-700">🛣️ Origins of Devonshire Road</h2>
      <p>
        Devonshire Road likely emerged in the late 1800s to early 1900s, tracing an eastern path from Exton through Devon, eventually intersecting with Contention Lane. Its growth mirrored the Main Line’s railroad-driven suburban expansion.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Though exact construction dates are elusive, early 20th-century maps likely contain its first recorded instances. Today, it remains a quiet corridor with deep roots.

      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-700">🚜 Surrounding Farms & Earliest Views</h2>
      <p>
        Devonshire was surrounded by working farms, orchards, and livestock fields. Stone foundations and Colonial Revival homes from the early 1900s still mark this legacy.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 text-sm">
        <li>Architecture from circa 1902–1905 still stands along the road.</li>
        <li>Properties such as <em>371 Devonshire Rd</em> (built 1959) and <em>167 Devonshire Rd</em> reflect mid-century suburbanization.</li>
        <li>Some homes were built atop or near original farming lots; others emerged after land preservation setbacks.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-700">🏫 Castlewood, Churches & Generations of Educators</h2>
      <p>
        Castlewood and its neighboring homes have long been connected to the Berwyn Baptist Church community. Several early residents were Sunday school leaders, pastors, or youth counselors.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        The area grew into a haven for TE School District educators—especially those involved in PTC (Parent-Teacher Council) activities—creating generational ties to learning, equity, and civic spirit.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 text-sm">
        <li>Many TE teachers chose to settle along Devonshire, walking distance to Valley Forge Middle and Conestoga High.</li>
        <li>The road became known for “teacher neighbors,” a term often shared among local students and parents.</li>
      </ul>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-700">📸 Oldest Photographic Records</h2>
      <p>
        While no digital images were found in public archives, aerial maps from the 1930s to 1950s show the area dominated by fields and early roadbeds. Local historians and longtime families likely have private photographs yet to be shared publicly.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Facebook groups, township records, and local libraries all reference Exton-to-Devon transitions, suggesting Devonshire grew in tandem with the wider Main Line’s post-war boom.

      <p>
        Devonshire Road is more than a street — it’s a lineage. The homes carry stories of settlers, educators, worship leaders, and caretakers of this land. Its humble beauty lies not in grandeur but in depth.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        One of those homes, <a href="https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/387-Devonshire-Rd-Devon-PA-19333/9182015_zpid/?view=public" class="text-yellow-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-yellow-900">387 Devonshire Road</a>, is now quietly listed for sale. If walls could speak, they would tell of dedication, family, and warmth. A new chapter awaits — as meaningful as the last.
