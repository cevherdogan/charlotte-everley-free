<p>Together, Clarke and Teegarden anchor Devon’s youth baseball circuit—Clarke nurturing the youngest players, and Teegarden bridging families and community moments across generations.</p>

  <h2>Volunteer Spirit</h2>
  <p>DSLL is a 100% volunteer-run 501(c)(3) supported by registration fees and community giving. Their recent renovation of Teegarden Field 4 totaled over $100,000, much of it crowdfunded via Venmo @DevonStraffordLL.</p>

  <h2>District Play & Community Culture</h2>
  <p>DSLL competes in District 27, with teams advancing to regionals every summer. But beyond wins and stats, it’s about community—sideline friendships, Saturday mornings, and memories passed down like gloves.</p>

  <p class="highlight">The grass may grow back each season, but the stories stay.</p>
