  <h1>Devonshire Road – Where Memory Walks Beside You</h1>
  <h3>Tracing faith, footsteps, and family through the green corridors of Devon</h3>

  <h2>🛄 A Road Layered in Legacy</h2>
  <p>
    Before driveways, Devonshire was direction. Long before SUVs and school pickups, it connected farmlands to freedom trails.
    From Valley Forge's whispers to Conestoga's wagon tracks, this corridor has been more than a road&mdash;it’s been a vessel of movement, memory, and meaning.
  </p>

  <h2>🪨 Historic Stone, Rail & Undercrossing</h2>
  <p>
    Midway down the road, a preserved underpass carries not just the Pennsylvania Railroad&mdash;but a century of waving children, first train sightings,
    and whispered family lore. Mapped on 19th-century survey atlases and still active today, it’s a visual reminder that movement can carry memory,
    and not just commuters.
  </p>

  <h2>🌿 From Harvest Fields to Hearthstones</h2>
  <p>
    Look closely&mdash;past the renovated façades. That ivy-covered shed near the creek? It once stored grain and iron tools.
    Numbers like 167 and 371 Devonshire echo a transition from plow to porch. These homes are not just real estate—they are reimagined ruins of agricultural grit.
  </p>

  <h2>🙇️‍♂️ Sacred Threads</h2>
  <p>
    Devon’s spiritual story is quilted. From the 1711 Great Valley Baptist beginnings to the quiet resolve of Mount Zion A.M.E. during desegregation—
    faith here wasn’t performance, it was promise. The pews at Berwyn Baptist and Valley Forge echo with more than hymns—they pulse with civic spirit
    and generational mentoring.
  </p>

  <h2>📓 Devonshire, The Teacher’s Row</h2>
  <p>
    Locals call it “teacher street.” Not in jest, but in reverence. This stretch once housed generations of T/E educators whose service extended
    beyond the bell. Parent-Teacher Councils were born around these hearths. Street corners doubled as symposiums. Education, here, was a lived landscape.
  </p>

  <h2>🧱 Time Etched in Stone: Teagarden & Jenkin Lewis</h2>
  <p>
    Behind Lancaster Road lies the Teagarden House—part colonial blacksmith hut, part Devon Tea House, entirely enduring. A few steps away,
    the 1763 Jenkin Lewis farmhouse leans into its age, windows half-lidded under slate. These aren’t relics. They are grandparents—quiet, observing, essential.
  </p>

  <h2>🏡 387 Devonshire: An Anchor, Not an Address</h2>
  <p>
    Now available as a For Sale by Owner listing, <a href="https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/387-Devonshire-Rd-Devon-PA-19333/9182015_zpid/" target="_blank">

  </p>
  <blockquote>
    Backed by trees, bracketed by trails, and buffered by history, this home is more than a lot. It’s a link in Devonshire’s living chain.
