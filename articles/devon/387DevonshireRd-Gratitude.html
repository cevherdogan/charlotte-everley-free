      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-700">🛣️ Origins and Early Roads</h2>
      <p class="mt-2">Devonshire likely emerged in the late 1800s to early 1900s as farms gave way to the growing suburban aspirations of the Main Line. The road follows a historical alignment that connects Route 202 to Valley Forge Road (Route 23), intersecting paths like Contention Lane, Sugartown, and Conestoga Roads. These corridors have always supported a tapestry of commerce, community, and liberty.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-700">🚂 Railroads and the Historic Underpass</h2>
      <p class="mt-2">The Pennsylvania Railroad, mapped in the historic Atlas of Surveys (Rosemont–Westchester), crosses over a stone underpass near Devon Station—still active and preserved. This same track glides past Washington's HQ in Valley Forge, connecting American memory with modern motion.</p>
      <p class="mt-2">To this day, children experience their first train rides here. Families gather trackside for photos and memories, embodying a living tradition. <span class="italic">It is more than transit; it is storytelling in motion.</span></p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-700">🌾 From Farms to Foundations</h2>
      <p class="mt-2">From early orchards and livestock plots, Devonshire’s land transformed over decades. Homes like 167 and 371 Devonshire trace back to post-agricultural expansion. A forgotten stone shed near the creek and bridge still whispers of its farmstead past—ivy-covered and dignified in silence.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-700">🏛️ Faith Anchors: From Tea House to Pews</h2>
      <p class="mt-2">Religious life in the Devon-Berwyn corridor thrives in historical continuity. From the 1711 Baptist Church in the Great Valley to Berwyn Baptist (1886), Valley Forge Baptist, and Mount Zion A.M.E. (1861), these spaces became pillars of education, resistance, and service.</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 text-sm">
        <li>Zion and Wayne Baptist extended spiritual lineage regionally</li>
        <li>Mount Zion A.M.E. served during the Berwyn School desegregation fight</li>
        <li>Berwyn Baptist volunteers were instrumental in local PTC programs</li>
      </ul>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-700">📘 Educator Generations and PTC Roots</h2>
      <p class="mt-2">Known affectionately as “teacher street,” Devonshire Road was home to T/E School District educators. Generational bonds developed through the Parent-Teacher Council (PTC), where civic service and classroom spirit intertwined. Legacy lived not just in classrooms—but in the very homes that lit the walk to school.</p>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-700">🧱 Archaeological Threads: The Teagarden House</h2>
      <p class="mt-2">Built around 1734 and later reimagined in 1914, the Teagarden House near Old Lancaster Rd once served as a blacksmith hut and the Devon Tea House. A neighboring 1763 farmhouse built by Jenkin Lewis echoes the same colonial spirit—two testaments to time, tucked quietly behind the present.</p>
