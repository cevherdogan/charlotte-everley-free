  <h1>Tracks Through Time – Devon’s Rail Reverie</h1>

  <p class="quote">“The steel lines that carved through Chester County carried more than passengers—they delivered the tempo of a town becoming.”</p>

  <h2>From Headquarters to Horse Country</h2>
  <p>While Washington’s troops hunkered down in Valley Forge, the land beyond Philadelphia began sowing its legacy. Nearly a century later, the Pennsylvania Railroad would thread its way west, echoing the route of a country’s expansion and settling towns like Devon into its rhythm.</p>

  <h2>Devon Station & the Underpass at Contention Lane</h2>
  <p>Still in use today, the Devon Station is served by SEPTA’s Paoli/Thorndale Line, with daily trains whispering past on their way between Center City and Paoli. Just beneath it, at Contention Lane, the underpass tucks under these same tracks—a forgotten industrial arch now woven into walking routes and childhood shortcuts.</p>

  <h2>A Daily Drumbeat</h2>
  <p>SEPTA trains operate here throughout the day, typically every 30–60 minutes during commuter peaks and hourly otherwise. Though Amtrak long passed its local stops, the cadence remains, tying morning routines to a much older schedule etched in steel and gravel.</p>

  <h2>Mapping Memory</h2>
  <p>At the Easttown Library, a sepia-toned survey map shows this stretch as it once was—boundary lines sketched by hand, station names lettered in looping script. The tracks run through it all like an EKG, pulsing through neighborhoods that grew around them.</p>

  <p class="quote">“To walk Devon is to follow the rails—even if you no longer hear them.”</p>
