  <h1>Berwyn: A Town with Quiet Charisma</h1>

  <div class="highlight">
    Tucked quietly between the bustle of Paoli and the charm of Devon, Berwyn is a Main Line gem that prefers subtlety over showmanship.
  </div>

  <h2>🌄 Morning Rituals</h2>
  <p>It's the kind of town where neighbors wave from porches, and morning walks are often paused for a chat outside La Cabra or a quick hello at Handel's.</p>

  <h2>🏘️ Real Homes, Real Community</h2>
  <p>Berwyn doesn’t chase the spotlight, but its strengths shine through its rhythms: top-tier schools like T/E, a train station that keeps Philly within reach, and a local culture anchored by institutions like the Footlighters Theater and Easttown Library. Families plant deep roots here, drawn by tree-lined streets and the kind of community where little league and library fundraisers still matter.</p>

  <h2>🌳 Green Spaces</h2>
  <p>There's a lived-in grace to Berwyn. Old stone colonials mingle with newer builds, and while yards are tidy, perfection isn’t the goal — warmth is. Stroll through Glenbrook or Daylesford and you’ll find a quiet confidence: gardens grown by hand, dogs at the ready, and kids walking to school with backpacks and laughter in tow.</p>

  <h2>🎭 The Town That Shows Up</h2>
  <div class="highlight">
    Berwyn isn’t about flash — it’s about feel. The kind you remember long after the open house. The kind that feels like coming home.
