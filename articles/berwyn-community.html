  <h1>Berwyn: Where the Quiet Speaks Volumes</h1>

  <p class="highlight">
    Nestled between Devon and Paoli, Berwyn holds its own kind of magic — the quiet, confident charm of a town that doesn’t need to prove itself.
  </p>

  <h2>🌄 Morning Rituals & Warm Welcomes</h2>
  <p>
    Days often begin with the scent of fresh bread from Clay’s Bakery or a pour-over from Filter Coffeehouse. It’s where neighbors know your name, and a front porch wave carries more than just greeting—it’s tradition.
  </p>

  <h2>🏘️ Real Homes, Real Community</h2>
  <p>
    Along Lancaster Avenue, life leaves space for conversation—whether it’s about local schools, art exhibits, or garden club news. From Cape Cod charmers to dignified colonials, homes here offer soul and spacious yards.
  </p>

  <h2>🌳 Green Spaces that Breathe</h2>
  <p>
    Jenkins Arboretum, the Chester Valley Trail, and private backyard pathways echo the area’s deep-rooted respect for nature. Tree-lined serenity invites morning walkers, stroller strolls, and after-dinner breezes.
  </p>

  <h2>🎭 The Town That Shows Up</h2>
  <p>
    Berwyn rallies—at Footlighters Theater, school fundraisers, Handel’s ice cream line. This is a town where presence matters, and support is second nature.
