  <h1>Stone, Sunlight, and Substance: A Devon Home That Understands What Matters</h1>
  <p>
    This home—a classic split-level tucked at the gentle meeting point of Hickory and Contention—offers more than just an address.
    Recently refreshed with thoughtful updates, its kitchen now centers around a granite mid-island that pulls in the morning light. A new roof and HVAC system quietly promise comfort and foresight.
    
    Out back, a secluded deck blends with the tree line. The hush of Valley Creek, Duportail trails, and neighborhood pathways infuse daily life with rhythm and peace.
    
    Neighbors wave from porches. Dogs stroll by. The arboretum, Wilson Farm Park, and Chesterbrook connect nature and community. This is not just real estate—it’s a living rhythm of Devon: thoughtful, enduring, and deeply livable.
