      <h2>🌿 Surrounding Context</h2>
      <p>947 Contention Lane is not just a residence—it’s a landscape memory. The home features multiple fireplaces, rustic outbuildings like a springhouse and a carriage house, and rests quietly in a <strong>park-like setting</strong>. It’s often referred to as a “revolutionary farm,” with hallmark features such as exposed interior beams and a preserved bank barn—testaments to its 18th-century origin and agrarian utility.</p>

      <h2>🧭 Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>As a <strong>colonial-era homestead</strong> on nearly five acres, 947 Contention Lane offers a rare glimpse into Pennsylvania’s architectural and land-holding heritage. Unlike many nearby parcels that have been subdivided for suburban development, this estate maintains its original breadth, narrative continuity, and visual integrity. Its survival into the present day, largely intact, is a quiet act of preservation within a rapidly modernizing region.</p>
