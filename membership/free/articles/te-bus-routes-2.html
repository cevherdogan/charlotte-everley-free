  <h1>TE School District Bus Routes & Community Map</h1>

  <p>The Tredyffrin/Easttown School District’s staggered bus system helps families move through their days with thoughtful rhythm. Older students depart first—usually by 2:30 p.m.—followed by younger elementary children closer to 3:30 p.m. This staging supports safety, sibling connection, and community flow.</p>

  <h2>⏰ Staged Schedules, Family First</h2>
  <p>This age-based timing helps:
    <ul>
      <li>Older kids return first—building responsibility and independent habits.</li>
      <li>Younger ones are greeted by family or neighbors in a safe rhythm.</li>
      <li>Parents manage pickups, playdates, and activities with ease.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>🧩 Community Ties by Design</h2>
  <p>These transportation rhythms reflect deeper community values—where families, not institutions, guide the pulse of daily life. The bus routes do more than connect homes to schools—they foster friendships at stops, peer support in transitions, and a sense of shared village care.</p>
