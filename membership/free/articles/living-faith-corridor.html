      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-700">🛣️ Origins & Transportation Roots</h2>
      <p>
        Emerging in the late 1800s to early 1900s, Devonshire Road connects Exton (Rt 202) and Valley Forge Road (Rt 23), running parallel to Contention Lane and other historic byways. It became a suburban spine bridging pastoral life and transportation corridors tied to Valley Forge’s Revolutionary-era heritage.

      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-700">🚜 Farms & Stone Foundations</h2>
      <p>
        Surprisingly, colonial-era farmhouses and orchards once lined Devonshire Road. Today, 167 and 371 Devonshire Roads echo the early 20th-century built legacy. An old stone shed near the creek and underpass—possibly a springhouse or caretaker hut—remains a silent relic.

      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-700">🏛️ Teagarden Log Cabin & Colonial Echoes</h2>
      <p>
        Just off Old Lancaster Road once stood the Teagarden log cabin (c. 1734), later serving as a blacksmith’s workshop and the “Devon Tea House,” rebuilt in 1914 by Brognard Okie. Nearby, a stone house built c. 1763 by Jenkin Lewis stands testimony to early colonial settlement.

      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-700">✝️ Religious & Baptist Heritage</h2>
      <p>
        Devonshire is interwoven with a Baptist lineage beginning with the Great Valley Baptist Church (Devon State Rd, 1711). From its roots came Valley Forge Baptist, Berwyn Baptist Chapel (1886), Mount Zion A.M.E. Church (1861), and branches to Zion and Wayne Baptist—forming a spiritual network that supported the community and the T/E schools.

      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-700">🏫 Educators & PTC Traditions</h2>
      <p>
        Known informally as “teacher street,” Devonshire became home to generations of T/E School District educators, many active in the Parent‑Teacher Council. Families often carried their educational legacy across generations, walking their students to Valley Forge Middle and Conestoga High.

      <p>
        Aerial maps from the 1930s–1950s document the shift from farmland to neighborhood grids. The stone creek-side shed and original cabins whisper a colonial story. For more, local historical societies may hold photos, deeds, and maps yet to be digitized.
