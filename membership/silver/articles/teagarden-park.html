  <h2>🎀 Charlotte’s Reflection: A Road Etched in Memory</h2>
  <p>If this story were told by Charlotte Everley, it might have danced a little softer, stretched a little longer. Her words would frame Devonshire not just as a road, but as a corridor of quiet devotion—layered with education, legacy, and spiritual resonance.</p>

  <h2>🤝 Community Vibe</h2>
  <p>Locals often say, “If you know, you know.” Teegarden is where high-fives meet hand-me-down mitts. It's the kind of space that isn’t found on Main Line tourist brochures—but it’s always full of life. </p>
