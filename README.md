## 🎀 Charlotte’s Reflection: A Road Etched in Memory
There would have been a huge difference, unmatched, and unique!! We coule easily say "If this story were told by Charlotte Everley, it might have danced a little softer, stretched a little longer. Her words would frame Devonshire not just as a road, but as a corridor of quiet devotion—layered with education, legacy, and spiritual resonance"

## 🛠️ DEV NOTES

This sets a clear development milestone and keeps things organized for future contributors (or for your future self 😉).

	•	Add a checklist for content editorial workflows too?
	•	a README root-level README summarizing the entire site architecture?
