## 🔍 Membership Structure and RBAC System – Inspection Analysis

### ✅ Summary

After an in-depth inspection of commit history, tags, release notes, and file structures, we’ve reconstructed a detailed understanding of the evolution of tier-based access and RBAC implementation in the `charlotte-everley-free` project.

## 🧠 Findings by Version & Tag

### **v0.2.2**

* ✅ Introduced trial welcome page
* ✅ Stripe trial support added
* ⚠️ No `/membership/*/index.html` directories yet

### **v0.3.0 → v0.3.5**

* ✅ Improved styling (hover states, borders)
* ⚠️ Still missing actual `/membership/` pages

### **v1.0-launch-charlotteeverley**

* ✅ Created `/membership/{trial,silver,gold,free}/index.html`
* ✅ Defined site structure and landing pages for each tier
* ✅ Included storytelling layouts, infographics, and SEO

### **v1.1.0 – RBAC Gallery Engine**

* ✅ RBAC logic introduced with `rbac-map.json`
* ✅ `generate_gallery.py`, `view_gallery.sh`, and `test_rbac_access.py`
* ✅ Gallery now access-controlled by tier

### **v1.2.0 – Metadata & Thumbnails**

* ✅ `article-metadata.json` + `thumbnail-map.json`
* ✅ Clickable gallery tiles
* ✅ Tier-specific linking: `membership/{tier}/articles/*.html`

### **v1.3.0**

* ⚠️ `/membership/{silver,gold,trial,free}/` folders were temporarily missing

git checkout v1.0-launch-charlotteeverley -- membership/
git add membership/
git commit -m "✅ Restored complete tiered membership content from v1.0-launch"

## 📁 To Be Confirmed/Completed

* [x] Confirm restored pages render locally
* [x] Re-link broken CTA buttons on index/gallery (visually confirmed functional)
* [ ] Add simulated tier switcher (e.g. via localStorage)
* [ ] Prepare for future Auth0/AA injection
* [x] Create `README.md` inside `/status` explaining purpose of reports
* [x] Create `todo/2025-08-01-membership-tracker.md` listing remaining tasks by milestone
* [x] Prepare ZIP backup of restored `/membership/` from `v1.0-launch`
